\chapter{Battery Modeling and Emulation}\label{ch:Battery_Modeling_Emulation}
The \textit{Battery} is a complex composition of lethal chemicals that are very hard to handle in terms of safety and maintenance. So, is those petroleum vehicles safe? No, Not at all petroleum products and vehicles are much more dangerous not only in terms of environmental pollution it in terms of safety and measures. Then we should raise the question of what stopping modern engineers to transition from petroleum engines to Battery vehicles. And which wall stopping us from battery usage? Well, to answer all the above questions we need to look back at the evolution of vehicles, the petroleum vehicle fetus came to this world nearly a century ago. Engineers thoroughly studied and learned how to handle petroleum products and petroleum vehicles. Undoubtedly, EVs are the gift of modern technology, but it is essential to study institutionally the battery characteristics and the testing.

It is the prime responsibility of every Electrical engineer who works in EVs/Battery systems to ensure the safety of mankind. Considering all the facts, I have decided to make safety and sophisticated system for engineers to test the BMS and play with BMS without interacting with the physical batteries. The \textit{Part I} of Chapter \ref{ch:Battery_Modeling_Emulation} gives more elaboration about the battery modeling and battery constructional theory. \textit{Part II} facilitates understanding of Battery model implementation and BMS simulation through coding.
