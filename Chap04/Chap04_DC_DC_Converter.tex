\subsubsection{Multiphase Bidirectional DC/DC Current Controller LM5170-Q1}
\indent The LM5170-q1 controller is a high precision dual channel bidirectional converter applicated in automotive 48 Volts and 12Volts dual battery systems. Depending on the Direction Signal DC/DC converter regulates the average current. The Regulated current through the DC/DC converter can be programmed by analog or Digital PWM inputs.

The LM5170-q1 has a dedicated dual channel differential current sense amplifier to monitor the current flowing through the Dc/Dc converter, which can achieve $1\%$ current sense accuracy. It has a Robust Gate driver to drive half the bridge. The Internal gate driver of the LM5170 has the capability of driving parallel MOSFET switches with a capacity of 500Watts. The synchronous diode emulation mode prevents the dc to dc converter from the negative currents and also enables the discontinuous mode of operation. This property enhances the DC/DC converter efficiency tremendously. The Controller can offer benefits of cycle-by-cycle current limitation, overVoltage protection at both low side and high side ports, Temperature protection and Mosfet failure so on...
