\section{Introduction}
There are plenty of topologies dedicated to the BMS active balancing, for instance, cell-to-cell charge balancing, cell-to-stack or stack-to-cell charge sharing, and stack charge sharing. Among such wide techniques cell to stack and stack-cell, charge-sharing techniques gain the upper hand because of their robustness and safety measures against the battery.
