\SpecialTitle{Abstract}

\noindent \textit{
    Determining the SOC ad SOH of the Li-Ion batteries by employing the Conventional Coloumb count method and sophisticated Kalman filter algorithms in a wireless communication network(BLE). 
    The proposed Architecture measures synchronized current and voltage for SOC and SOH calculation by ensuring safety and adaptivity. 
    By employing the Most Robust and Elegant Wireless Communication Network(BLE) in BMS, the architecture mitigates the problem of bulky and wired setups.
